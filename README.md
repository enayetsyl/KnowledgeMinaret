### Folder Structure

The "Knowledge Minaret" project follows an organized folder structure to maintain clarity and scalability:

- components: This folder contains reusable components used throughout the application. It also holds components specific to the home page, while the ui subfolder contains Aceternity UI components.

- route: Components related to the remaining three routes are stored in respective route folder. Each route folder has its own components.

- constants: The index.ts file in this folder stores all the constants used in the project, ensuring centralized management and easy access to project-wide values.

- types: This folder contains the types.ts file, which defines all the types used in the project. Centralizing types improves code readability and maintainability.

- public: Images and other static assets are stored in this folder, making them easily accessible to the application.

- data: Necessary JSON data files are stored in this folder, providing structured data for the application's functionality.

- utils: The cn function for Aceternity UI is stored in this folder, providing utility functions specific to the project.

### Clean Code Practices

- Organized Folder Structure: The project follows a clear and logical folder structure, grouping related files together for easy navigation and maintenance.

- Separation of Concerns: Components are organized into separate folders based on their functionality and usage within the application, promoting modularity and reusability.

- Centralized Constants and Types: Constants and types are centralized in dedicated folders, reducing duplication and ensuring consistency throughout the codebase.

- Descriptive Naming: File and folder names are chosen to be descriptive and meaningful, making it easier for developers to understand their purpose and contents.

- Code Readability: Careful attention is paid to formatting, indentation, and commenting to ensure code readability and comprehension.

- Use of Reusable Components: Reusable components are stored in separate folders and are designed to be easily adaptable and reusable across different parts of the application.

By adhering to these clean code practices and maintaining a well-organized folder structure, the "Knowledge Minaret" project aims to enhance code maintainability, readability, and scalability, ultimately resulting in a more efficient and sustainable development process.


### Design Section

The design of the "Knowledge Minaret" web application combines the robust capabilities of Aceternity UI with customizations tailored to meet the project's specific requirements. Leveraging the power of React Three Fiber and Framer Motion, the design achieves a harmonious balance between functionality, aesthetics, and interactivity.

- Aceternity UI Integration

Out of the 42 components available in Aceternity UI, 24 have been thoughtfully incorporated into the website. While some components are used as-is, many have undergone significant customization to align with the unique needs of the project. This approach ensures that the design remains consistent with the Aceternity UI framework while also allowing for flexibility and adaptation to the project's design goals.
React Three Fiber for 3D Animation
The integration of React Three Fiber adds an extra dimension to the design, introducing captivating 3D animations and visualizations that enhance the overall user experience. These dynamic elements serve to engage and captivate users, providing an immersive journey through the content and reinforcing key concepts and themes.

- Framer Motion for Enhanced Design

Framer Motion is extensively utilized throughout the design to create fluid and expressive animations, transitions, and micro-interactions. By leveraging Framer Motion's capabilities, the design achieves a level of polish and sophistication that elevates the user interface, making interactions intuitive and delightful.

- Customizations for Project Needs

While Aceternity UI provides a solid foundation, customizations have been made to ensure that the design aligns closely with the project's goals and branding. These customizations range from color schemes and typography choices to layout adjustments and component styling, resulting in a cohesive and visually appealing design that reflects the unique identity of the "Knowledge Minaret" web application.
